# Simplified azure cloud adoption framework

The [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) helps customers undertake a simplified cloud adoption journey. The framework contains detailed information about an end-to-end cloud adoption journey and is designed primarily for cloud architects and the cloud strategy teams leading cloud adoption efforts. This blog post primarily focus on step-by-step checklist that can help you complete your journey based on Microsoft azure cloud adoption framework recommended practices.

#### Azure adoption checklist

* [x] **Start strategy and plan** - establishing clear [business outcomes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/), a clearly defined [digital estate plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/), and well-understood [adoption backlogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/migration-considerations/prerequisites/migration-backlog-review)
  * [x] Get critical business events e.g. data-center exit
  * [x] Get cloud business motivation against each event e.g. Cost savings
  * [ ] Classify each motivation as migration or innovation e.g. Cost saving for migration or Increasing business agility for innovation
  * [ ] **See** [**documenting business outcomes**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/business-outcome-template)**, or download the** [**business outcome template**](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/business-outcome-template.xlsx) **\[TOOL\]**
  * [ ] Define fiscal outcomes e.g. increased revenue, reduced cost or increased profit
  * [ ] Define agility outcomes e.g. faster time to market or low provision time
  * [ ] Define reach-ability outcomes e.g. global access or data sovereignty
  * [ ] Define customer engagement outcomes e.g. cycle time, see [six sigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/cycle-time/)
  * [ ] Define performance outcomes e.g. Increase in number of transactions or capacity
  * [ ] Define reliability outcomes e.g. High uptime
  * [ ] Understand and explain the myths
    * [ ] The cloud is always cheaper
    * [ ] Everything should go into the cloud
    * [ ] Mirroring my on-premises environment will help me save money in the cloud
    * [ ] Server costs drive business cases for cloud migration

    * [ ] Moving to the cloud is like flipping a switch
  * [ ] Calculate revenue deltas
  * [ ] Calculate cost deltas e.g. operating cost reductions
  * [ ] Calculate gains $$Gains = Revenue Deltas + CostDeltas$$ 
  * [ ] Build a business justification $$ROI = (Gain - Investment)/Investment$$
  * [ ] Transform account model i.e. cost center to profit center using charge back or showback or awareness-back models
