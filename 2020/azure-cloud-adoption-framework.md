#### Azure adoption checklist

* [x] **Start strategy and plan** - establishing clear [business outcomes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/), a clearly defined [digital estate plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/), and well-understood [adoption backlogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/migration-considerations/prerequisites/migration-backlog-review)
  * [x] Get critical business events e.g. data-center exit
  * [x] Get cloud business motivation against each event e.g. Cost savings
  * [ ] Classify each motivation as migration or innovation e.g. Cost saving for migration or Increasing business agility for innovation
  * [ ] See [documenting business outcomes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/business-outcome-template), or download the [business outcome template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/business-outcome-template.xlsx).
  * [ ] Define fiscal outcomes e.g. increased revenue, reduced cost or increased profit
  * [ ] Define agility outcomes e.g. faster time to market or low provision time
  * [ ] Define reach-ability outcomes e.g. global access or data sovereignty
  * [ ] Define customer engagement outcomes e.g. cycle time, see [six sigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/cycle-time/)
  * [ ] Define performance outcomes e.g. Increase in number of transactions or capacity
  * [ ] Define reliability outcomes e.g. High uptime
  * [ ] Understand and explain the myths
    * [ ] The cloud is always cheaper
    * [ ] Everything should go into the cloud
    * [ ] Mirroring my on-premises environment will help me save money in the cloud
    * [ ] Server costs drive business cases for cloud migration
    * [ ] An operating expense model is better than a capital expense model
    * [ ] Moving to the cloud is like flipping a switch
  * [ ] Calculate revenue deltas
  * [ ] Calculate cost deltas e.g. operating cost reductions
  * [ ] Calculate gains $$Gains = Revenue Deltas + CostDeltas$$ 
  * [ ] Build a business justification $$ROI = (Gain - Investment)/Investment$$
  * [ ] Transform account model i.e. cost center to profit center using charge back or showback or awareness-back models
  * [ ] Identify first adoption project
  * [ ] Inform business about depth of justification vs time to business impact
  * [ ] Inform business about depth of initial planning vs delayed technical decisions
  * [ ] Inform business about long-term operations vs time to adoption
  * [ ] Inform business about re-hosting vs re-architecture
  * [ ] Inform business about feature focus vs customer empathy
  * [ ] Inform business about well-governed vs speed/agility
  * [ ] Inform business about broad management investments vs no -ops /low ops

* [ ] **Start Adoption** - Ensure proper implementation of desired changes, across IT and business processes, to achieve business outcomes.
  * [ ] **Start Migration** - Iterative execution of the [cloud implementation methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/getting-started/migrate#cloud-implementation) adhering to the tested process of Assess, Migrate, Optimize, and Secure & Manage to create a repeatable process for migrating workloads.
  * [ ] **Start Innovation** - Drive business value through innovation activities that unlock new technical skills and expanded business capabilities.
